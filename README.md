julia-tsne
==========

Julia port of L.J.P. van der Maaten and G.E. Hintons T-SNE visualisation technique
Please observe, that it is still not extensively tested. 

The examples in the 'examples' dir requires you to have Gadfly and RDatasets installed

**Please note:** At some point something changed in Julia which caused poor results, it took a while before I noted this but now  I have updated the implementation so that it works again. See the link below for images rendered using this implementation.
